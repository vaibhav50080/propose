        <p>Lemme gather the courage to say things in front of you!</p>

        <p>
          As I sit down to write this letter, I'm filled with excitement and
          nerves, but most of all, with love for you.
        </p>

        <p>
         I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you… the way you think, your honesty, and the warmth you bring
        </p>

        <p>
          Even in such a short time, you’ve made a special place in my heart.

I know love takes time, and I don’t want to rush anything. But I can’t keep this to myself — I like you, truly, and I want to be someone who makes you feel cared for, happy, and special every day.

        </p>

          Please take your time to consider my proposal, and know that no matter
          what your decision may be, I will always cherish the moments we've
          shared and hold you dear to my heart.
        </p>

        <p>With all my love and admiration,</p>
